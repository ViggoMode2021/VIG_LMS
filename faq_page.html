				<div class="faq-content">
					<p> VigLMS is an LMS (Learning Management System) created by former high school Spanish teacher and current backend software developer, Ryan Viglione.

				<a class="trigger" href="#0">What technology is used by VigLMS?</a>
				<div class="faq-content">
					<p>VigLMS is coded in Python/Flask (backend) and simple HTML and CSS (frontend). This faq page is the only page on the app
                    that has Javascript. We use a PostgreSQL database powered by Amazon RDS that is connected with Psycopg2. For file upload
                    and download, we use an Amazon S3 bucket that is connected with Boto3. VigLMS is deployed on Google Cloud App Engine and the
                    domain is powered by Google as well.</p>
