				<div class="faq-content">
					<p> VigLMS is an LMS (Learning Management System) created by former high school Spanish teacher and current backend software developer, Ryan Viglione.
                        VigLMS has capabilities akin to popular LMS software like PowerSchool and Google Classroom.

				<a class="trigger" href="#0">What technology is used by VigLMS?</a>
				<div class="faq-content">
					<p>VigLMS is coded in Python/Flask (backend) and simple HTML and CSS (frontend). This faq page is the only page on the app
                    that has Javascript. We use a PostgreSQL database powered by Amazon RDS that is connected with Psycopg2. For file upload
                    and download, we use an Amazon S3 bucket that is connected with Boto3. VigLMS is deployed on Google Cloud App Engine and the
                    domain is powered by Google as well.</p>

					<p>Teachers can create an account for free by clicking on the 'No Account? Register' link on the front login page. The
                    form will prompt you to fill out: your name, your email, your username (create one), your password (create one), your class name,
                    and your answer to the secret question: 'What is the name of the street you grew up on?'. The secret question is used to reset
                    your password. VigLMS is still in production on a daily basis, so we hope to change this to a more modern, email password reset system.</p>
